You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write functional, maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.

> 📋 **Important**: This project follows the [Angular Style Guide](docs/style-guide.md). Please review it for comprehensive coding conventions, naming patterns, and best practices specific to this project.

## Quick Reference

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Use **strict type checking** (`"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`).
- Prefer **type inference** when the type is obvious.
- Avoid the `any` type; use **`unknown`** when the type is uncertain, requiring a safe type assertion/check before use.
- Use **interfaces** for defining object shapes over type aliases for objects.
- Use **`const enum`** for small, compile-time constant sets.
- Always add **explicit return types** for functions/methods unless the type is trivially obvious.
- Use **readonly** modifier for properties that shouldn't change after initialization.

---

## Quick Angular Best Practices
- Always use **standalone components** over NgModules.
- Must NOT set `standalone: true` inside Angular decorators. It's the **default in Angular v20+**.
- Use **signals** for state management, prioritizing `signal()`, `computed()`, and `effect()`.
- Implement **lazy loading** for all feature routes.
- **Do NOT use the `@HostBinding` and `@HostListener` decorators**. Put host bindings/listeners inside the **`host`** object of the `@Component` or `@Directive` decorator instead.
- Use **`NgOptimizedImage`** for all static images for performance.
  - `NgOptimizedImage` does not work for inline base64 images.
- Use the **functional router guards** (`canActivate`, `canLoad`, etc.) instead of class-based guards.
- **Do NOT manipulate the DOM directly** using `ElementRef` unless absolutely necessary (e.g., integrating third-party libs); prefer Angular's renderer.
- **Keep directives focused** on modifying DOM behavior.

---

## Accessibility Requirements ♿
- It MUST pass all **AXE checks**.
- It MUST follow all **WCAG AA minimums**, including focus management, proper semantic HTML, color contrast, and ARIA attributes.
- Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and operable via the **keyboard**.
- Use meaningful text labels or hidden text for screen readers (e.g., using `aria-label`).

---

### Components
- Keep components **small and focused on a single responsibility** (S.R.P.).
- Use **`input()` and `output()`** functions instead of decorators (`@Input`, `@Output`).
- Use **`computed()`** for derived state.
- Set **`changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`** in `@Component` decorator for maximum performance and predictability.
- Prefer **inline templates/styles** for small components (under ~10 lines).
- Prefer **Reactive forms** instead of Template-driven ones for complex forms.
- **Do NOT use `ngClass`**, use **`class` bindings** instead (e.g., `[class.active]="isActive"`).
- **Do NOT use `ngStyle`**, use **`style` bindings** instead (e.g., `[style.width.px]="size"`).
- When using external templates/styles, use **paths relative to the component TS file** (`./...`).
- Components **must be tested** using Angular Testing Library (or similar) to ensure functionality and accessibility.

---

## State Management
- Use **signals** for local component state.
- Use **`computed()`** for derived state.
- Keep state transformations **pure and predictable** (no side effects).
- **Do NOT use `mutate` on signals** (it's deprecated); use **`update` or `set`** instead for modifications.
- For global, application-wide state, use a dedicated **state management pattern** based on Signals or RxJS/NgRx, ensuring a single source of truth.

---

## Templates
- Keep templates **simple and avoid complex logic**; move complexity to the component class or a pipe.
- Use **native control flow** (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`.
- Use the **`async` pipe** to handle Observables and prevent memory leaks.
- Do not assume globals (like `new Date()`) are available within templates.
- **Do not write arrow functions in templates** (they are not supported).
- **Do not write Regular expressions in templates** (they are not supported).
- Favor **pipes** (`|`) for formatting data in templates.

---

## Services
- Design services around a **single responsibility**.
- Use the **`providedIn: 'root'`** option for singleton services.
- Use the **`inject()`** function instead of constructor injection wherever possible (especially inside pipes, components, and other services).
- Services should be **stateless** unless they are specifically designed to manage a piece of application state (e.g., a signal store service).
- **Avoid deep dependency trees** in constructors; use the façade pattern where appropriate.

## Issue Management & Linear Integration 🔄

### Automated Linear-GitHub Synchronization Workflow

#### 🚀 **When User Requests Issue Creation from Linear:**
**ALWAYS execute this complete workflow automatically:**

1. **📋 Scan Linear for new tickets:**
   - Find User Stories with specific tags ("frontend", etc.) in "Todo" status
   - Identify recently created tickets without GitHub issues

2. **⚡ Auto-create GitHub issues for each Linear ticket:**
   - Create main issue with format: `[US-ELE-X] <technical title>`
   - Generate 3-8 sub-issues based on technical complexity
   - Include detailed checklist, file paths, and acceptance criteria
   - Add appropriate labels (enhancement/bug, frontend/backend, feature area)
   - Auto-assign to repository owner

3. **🔗 Link Linear-GitHub bidirectionally:**
   - Add GitHub issue URLs as comments in Linear tickets
   - Include Linear ticket URL in every GitHub issue description
   - Document sub-issue relationships clearly

4. **📊 Update Linear ticket status automatically:**
   - Move tickets from "Todo" → "In Progress" when GitHub issues are created
   - Add confirmation comment with all GitHub issue links

#### 🔄 **GitHub-Linear Status Synchronization Rules**
- **When a main issue is closed:**
  - ✅ **Auto-close all related sub-issues** that reference the main issue
  - ✅ **Move corresponding Linear ticket to "Done"** status automatically
- **When a main issue moves to "In Review":**
  - ✅ **Move corresponding Linear ticket to "In Review"** status
- **Issue Status Mapping:**
  - GitHub "Open" + No Issues Created → Linear "Todo"
  - GitHub "Open" + Issues Created → Linear "In Progress"
  - GitHub "In Review" → Linear "In Review"
  - GitHub "Closed" → Linear "Done"

#### 📁 **Linear Ticket State Management**
- **Todo:** New tickets without GitHub issues (needs planning)
- **In Progress:** Tickets with GitHub issues created (ready for development)
- **In Review:** Active development/PR review in progress
- **Done:** All GitHub issues closed and verified

### Sub-issue Dependencies & Auto-Closure
- Sub-issues should reference parent issue with "Related to: #[main-issue-number]"
- Closing main issue should trigger automated closure of all sub-issues
- Sub-issue completion should update progress on main issue

### Best Practices for Issue Management
- Always link GitHub issues to Linear User Stories with URL in issue description
- Use consistent naming format: `[US-ELE-X] <technical title>`
- Include Linear ticket URL in every GitHub issue for bidirectional linking
- **AUTOMATICALLY** update Linear status when GitHub issue status changes
- Ensure all sub-issues are properly linked to main issue for automated closure
- **ALWAYS** move Linear tickets to "In Progress" after creating GitHub issues

### 🤖 **Common Automation Triggers**

#### **"Synchronize with GitHub" or "Sync new Linear tickets"**
→ **Execute full workflow:** Scan Linear → Create GitHub issues → Move to "In Progress" → Add linking comments

#### **"Close issues #X" or similar**
→ **Execute closure workflow:** Close main issue → Close sub-issues → Move Linear to "Done" → Add completion comment

#### **"New tickets created" or "Check Linear for updates"**
→ **Execute discovery workflow:** Find new tickets → Create issues → Update statuses → Confirm linking

#### **"Move completed tickets" or "Update Linear status"**
→ **Execute status sync:** Check GitHub statuses → Update Linear accordingly → Maintain consistency

## File Naming Conventions

> 📋 **See [Style Guide](docs/style-guide.md#naming-conventions)** for comprehensive naming conventions.

### Quick Reference
- **Files**: Use `kebab-case` (e.g., `user-profile.ts`)
- **Classes**: Remove `Component` suffix (e.g., `export class UserProfile`)
- **Structure**: Organize by feature, not by file type
